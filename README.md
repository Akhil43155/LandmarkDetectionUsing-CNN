# Landmark Detection using CNN and Streamlit
## Project Overview:

The Landmark Detection project is a fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Streamlit, aiming to develop a robust system for landmark recognition. Leveraging TensorFlow's powerful CNN models and a Streamlit-based web interface, this project allows users to upload images and accurately identify landmarks, displaying their locations on a map.

## Problem Statement:

The project aims to pioneer a sophisticated landmark detection system using CNNs. It focuses on training with diverse image datasets showcasing global landmarks, facilitating precise identification and categorization within novel images. The objective is to empower users with tools for immersive exploration and orientation in unfamiliar cityscapes.

## Features:

Image upload functionality for landmark recognition
Utilizes TensorFlow's CNN models for accurate landmark identification
Displays predicted landmark along with its location using Streamlit and geopy
